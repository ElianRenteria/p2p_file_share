# Peer-to-Peer File Sharing Web App

This web application enables users to share files peer-to-peer using a simple and intuitive interface. Users can upload files, download all the files currently on the server as a zip folder, and clear all files on the server.

## Features

- **Upload Files**: Users can upload multiple files to the server.
- **Download Files**: Users can download all the files currently stored on the server as a single zip file.
- **Clear Files**: Users can clear all files from the server, refreshing the storage for new files.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Vue.js
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)

## How It Works

1. **Upload**: Users can select and upload multiple files. These files are stored on the server and can be accessed by other users.
2. **Download**: All users can download the uploaded files as a single zip archive.
3. **Clear**: Once the files are no longer needed, any user can clear all files from the server, making room for new uploads.

This application facilitates peer-to-peer file sharing where users interact with the server directly to manage files.
